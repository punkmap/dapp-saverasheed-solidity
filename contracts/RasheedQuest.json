    "intro": "<p>
          A few months ago, Rasheed was on a geocache hike and he was abducted
          by aliens. Rasheed escaped, but not without being tested with
          radioactive materials beforehand! Rasheed made it back to Earth
          safely, but now his beard has grown quite a bit! It glows green when
          he is sleeping, and he occasionally sleepwalks. Sometimes, he will
          sleepwalk all the way across the state of California!
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever he sleepwalks, aliens will arrive at his last known location;
          they still need to do more tests and want to abduct him again!
        </p>
